How to change the network profile from Public to Private, in Windows:
The best way is just to go to Powershell
  First, let's get the configured networks profiles:
  get-netconnectionprofile

  Then, with the information gathered, set it to Public, for example:
  set-netconnectionprofile -name "This_Shall_Be_A_Private_Network" -network Private
